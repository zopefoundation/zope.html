Views on editable HTML
======================

Let's start by uploading some HTML to create a file object::

  >>> import StringIO
  >>> sio = StringIO.StringIO("This is a <em>fragment</em>."
  ...                         "  There's one 8-bit Latin-1 character: \xd8.")

  >>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
  >>> browser = Browser()
  >>> browser.addHeader("Authorization", "Basic user:userpw")
  >>> browser.addHeader("Accept-Language", "en-US")
  >>> browser.open("http://localhost/@@+/zope.file.File")

  >>> ctrl = browser.getControl(name="form.data")
  >>> ctrl.mech_control.add_file(sio, "text/html", "sample.html")
  >>> browser.getControl("Add").click()

We can see that the MIME handlers have marked this as HTML content::

  >>> import zope.mimetype.types
  >>> file = getRootFolder()["sample.html"]
  >>> zope.mimetype.types.IContentTypeTextHtml.providedBy(file)
  True

The "Edit" view can be used to check and modify the "Is fragment?"
field, which is stored by the views in an annotation on the object.
The particular fragment we uploaded here should be see as a fragment
by default::

  >>> browser.getLink("sample.html").click()
  >>> browser.getLink("Edit").click()

  >>> browser.open("http://localhost/sample.html/@@htmledit.html")
  >>> ctrl = browser.getControl(name="form.isFragment")
  >>> ctrl.value
  True

The setting can be toggle by unchecking the checkbox and clicking
"Save"::

  >>> ctrl.value = False
  >>> browser.getControl("Save").click()
  >>> ctrl = browser.getControl(name="form.isFragment")
  >>> ctrl.value
  False

The edit view also allows editing of the HTML content if the document
can be decoded.  If the encoding of the document is not known, the
document cannot be edited by the user is prompted to select an
encoding that should be used.

Our example document does not have a specified encoding, so we expect
the form to indicate that the encoded is needed, and to allow the user
to select and encoding.  Let's reload the form to get rid of the
"Updated..." message so we can see what the user is told::

  >>> browser.getLink("Edit").click()

  >>> print browser.contents
  <...Can't decode text for editing; please specify the document encoding...

  >>> ctrl = browser.getControl(name="form.encoding")
  >>> ctrl.value
  ['']

The user can then select an encoding::

  >>> ctrl.value = ["utf-8"]
  >>> browser.getControl("Save").click()

Since we just selected an encoding that doesn't work with the Latin-1
data we uploaded for the file, we're told that that encoding is not
acceptable::


  >>> print browser.contents
  <...Selected encoding cannot decode document...

We need to select an encoding that actually makes sense for the data
that we've uploaded::

  >>> ctrl = browser.getControl(name="form.encoding")
  >>> ctrl.value = ["iso-8859-1"]
  >>> browser.getControl("Save").click()

Now that the encoding has been saved, the document can be encoded and
edited, and the encoding selection will no longer be available on the
form::

  >>> browser.getControl(name="form.encoding")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  LookupError: name 'form.encoding'

Since our selected encoding does not support all Unicode characters,
there is an option available to allow re-encoding of the document if
the content being saved after editing cannot be encoded in the
original encoding of the document.  The value of this option defaults
to False since the user needs to be aware that the document encoding
may be modified::

  >>> browser.getControl(name="form.reencode").value
  False

If we edit the text such that characters are included that cannot be
encoded in the current encoding and try to save our changes without
allowing re-encoding, we see a notification that the document can't be
encoded in the original encoding and that re-encoding is needed::

  >>> ctrl = browser.getControl(name="form.text")
  >>> ctrl.value = u"\u3060\u3051\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8".encode("utf-8")

  >>> browser.getControl("Save").click()

  >>> print browser.contents
  <...Can't encode text in current encoding...

At this point, we can select the "Re-encode" option to allow the text
to be saved in an encoding other than the original; this would allow
us to save any text::

  >>> browser.getControl(name="form.reencode").value = True
  >>> browser.getControl("Save").click()

  >>> print browser.contents
  <...Updated on ...

If we now take a look at the "Content Type" view for the file, we see
that the encoding has been updated to UTF-8::

  >>> browser.getLink("Content Type").click()

  >>> browser.getControl(name="form.encoding").value
  ['utf-8']
