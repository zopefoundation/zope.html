Things that need to be done
---------------------------

- When encoding text, make sure everything is encoded (nothing is left
  over), and deal with errors.

- Make it possible for a user to override the use of the GUI editor
  with a preference setting, possibly allowing a different editor to
  be plugged in.

- Update to FCKeditor 2.3.2 (or newer).  This involves risk for existing
  projects, so should be done on a branch to allow testing prior to
  merging with the trunk.

- Better widgets, with less haphazard configurability.  There should
  really be display widgets as well.
